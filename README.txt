*** caetviewer Version 0.1 ***

Hi Hack(h)ers! This project is effectively an e-reader for the command line. It should work for all operating systems (Windows, Linux, MacOS), but has only been tested on Linux Mint.

This...sort of sounds useless, I know, but admittedly I'm allured by the aesthetic of the command line. As a very stereotypical Linux user, I think it's a beautiful and simple way to communicate with the computer. The resemblence to MS DOS era software also creates a nostalgic effect. I'm very artistically inspired by the Vaporwave subculture.

Ultimately, the purpose of this program is for art. Instead of publishing my own writing (which, itself, is esoteric) through traditional means such as in books or on online services like Tumblr or A03, I intend to use this. The executable of caetviewer containing whichever writing piece will be posted to my website (https://peepycat.neocities.org/, a WIP) which can then be downloaded and viewed by the user. The nature of this method of reading allows me to control the user's experience, strip away unnecessary CSS/Javascript that most text-sharing websites contain, and allows me to hone the aesthetic mentioned above.

I also want to touch on the paragraph-by-paragraph format of caetviewer. This is for the program to be more accessible for people with ADHD like myself. I often try to read three paragraphs at a time, which makes reading slower and undermines my comprehension. I find reading paragraph-by-paragraph to better my ability to focus. The controls are also fairly simple to keep the user in the "flow" so to speak. I also added a feature to allow the reader to continue if they choose to read in several sessions.

I used H.P. Lovecraft's "The Call of Cthulhu" as demo text. I should probably disclaim that I dislike Lovecraft personally and that his immense racism disgusts me. However, he is a prolific author whose works are well known to the point that the judges can practice discretion in reading his works. My work itself is in the cosmic horror that he (sadly) invented, so a piece of Lovecraft's work is probably the closest text to my own that exists in the public domain. My own work is also incomplete and contains disturbing content, so I don't feel right showing it without discretion.

This was long. Thank you for reading!
